# ClickTweet

Tweet whatever you are viewing (text, images, links etc) with a right-click!
LiveTweeting your favorite show? No need to pause! Reading a fascinating article? No need to leave the page!

ClickTweet is a simple extension which allows Twitter users to simply right-click the content they want to tweet (be it a page, image, link or highlighted text) and tweet directly. Here's the catch: You don't even need to manually open Twitter to post! Simply tweet what you want without having to leave what you are currently working on. 

Ever wanted to share text, the link to a page, image or hyperlink and had to:
* Copy content
* Open Twitter
* Click the "New Tweet" button
* Then post the tweet, before going back to what you were viewing?

Sounds like such a hassle, doesn't it? 

Here's where we come in.

ClickTweet's procedure is really simple:
* Right-click content to be tweeted
* Select ClickTweet
* Tweet the content

Simple as it ought to be, right?
